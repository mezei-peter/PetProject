# PetProject

## Intro
My personal fullstack project with React.js and Java Spring. Users can organize their
pets into tree structures and perform various operations on the data. I am planning to
add community features, such as sharing Pet Trees and liking them. Currently it is in a quite early phase.

## Used technologies
- Java
  - Spring Boot
- Javascript
  - React.js
The frontend and the backend communicate with each other through HTTP requests.

## Features 
- User has pets.
- The name and weight of pets is stored in a binary tree structure, rendered on the frontend.
- User can add pet to the tree.
- User can drag and zoom into the tree rendering window.
- Responsive frontend.

#### Planned features
- Prettier UI.
- More CRUD operations on pets: remove, update.
- Storing and restructuring trees into more complex structures: *binary search tree* or *red-black tree*.
- Login system.
- Ability to save a pet tree to the user's pet tree library.
- Browsing other users' pet trees.
